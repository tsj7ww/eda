# Fraud Detection Evaluation: In-Depth Analysis of Metrics and Methods

## Introduction

The `FraudEvaluator` class implements a comprehensive framework for evaluating fraud detection models. This document provides a detailed explanation of key concepts, metrics, and techniques used in the evaluation process, along with their advantages and limitations.

## 1. Core Evaluation Metrics

### Confusion Matrix

**Definition:** A table that categorizes predictions into four categories:
- **True Positive (TP)**: Correctly identified fraud
- **False Positive (FP)**: Incorrectly flagged as fraud (false alarm)
- **True Negative (TN)**: Correctly identified as legitimate
- **False Negative (FN)**: Missed fraud (fraud that passed undetected)

**Code Implementation:**
```python
cm = confusion_matrix(y_true, y_pred)
tn, fp, fn, tp = cm.ravel()
```

**Pros:**
- Provides complete information about all prediction outcomes
- Basis for calculating most other metrics
- Helps understand the types of errors a model makes

**Cons:**
- Raw numbers can be hard to interpret without context
- Not normalized by default, making comparison between datasets difficult
- Doesn't provide a single performance figure

### Accuracy

**Definition:** The proportion of correct predictions among the total number of predictions.

**Formula:** (TP + TN) / (TP + TN + FP + FN)

**Code Implementation:**
```python
metrics['accuracy'] = (tp + tn) / (tp + tn + fp + fn)
```

**Pros:**
- Simple to understand
- Good for balanced datasets

**Cons:**
- Highly misleading for imbalanced data (like fraud detection)
- A model that predicts "no fraud" for all transactions can have high accuracy
- Does not differentiate between types of errors

### Precision

**Definition:** The proportion of predicted fraud cases that are actually fraud.

**Formula:** TP / (TP + FP)

**Code Implementation:**
```python
metrics['precision'] = tp / (tp + fp) if (tp + fp) > 0 else 0
```

**Pros:**
- Focuses on minimizing false alarms
- Important when investigation resources are limited
- High value means fewer wasted investigations

**Cons:**
- Can be maximized by being very conservative (only flagging obvious fraud)
- Does not account for missed fraud
- Can give misleading results with tiny sample sizes

### Recall (Sensitivity, True Positive Rate)

**Definition:** The proportion of actual fraud cases that are correctly detected.

**Formula:** TP / (TP + FN)

**Code Implementation:**
```python
metrics['recall'] = tp / (tp + fn) if (tp + fn) > 0 else 0
```

**Pros:**
- Directly measures how much fraud is caught
- High value means less fraud goes undetected
- Critical when missing fraud is costly

**Cons:**
- Can be maximized by flagging everything as fraud
- Does not account for false alarms
- Can lead to excessive false positives

### Specificity (True Negative Rate)

**Definition:** The proportion of legitimate transactions correctly identified as non-fraudulent.

**Formula:** TN / (TN + FP)

**Code Implementation:**
```python
metrics['specificity'] = tn / (tn + fp) if (tn + fp) > 0 else 0
```

**Pros:**
- Measures how well the model handles legitimate cases
- Important for customer experience (avoiding false alarms)
- Complementary to recall

**Cons:**
- Less emphasis in fraud detection than recall
- Can still have high value even if all fraud is missed
- May be less important than precision in some contexts

### F1 Score

**Definition:** The harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balance between the two.

**Formula:** 2 × (Precision × Recall) / (Precision + Recall)

**Code Implementation:**
```python
metrics['f1_score'] = 2 * tp / (2 * tp + fp + fn) if (2 * tp + fp + fn) > 0 else 0
```

**Pros:**
- Balances precision and recall
- Single metric for easier comparison
- Effective for imbalanced datasets
- Penalizes extreme imbalances between precision and recall

**Cons:**
- Obscures the precision-recall tradeoff
- Equal weight to precision and recall may not reflect business priorities
- Harmonic mean is harder to intuitively understand

### False Alarm Rate (False Positive Rate)

**Definition:** The proportion of legitimate transactions incorrectly flagged as fraud.

**Formula:** FP / (FP + TN)

**Code Implementation:**
```python
metrics['false_alarm_rate'] = fp / (fp + tn) if (fp + tn) > 0 else 0
```

**Pros:**
- Directly measures customer impact
- Important for maintaining trust and service quality
- Used in ROC curve analysis

**Cons:**
- May be less important than missing fraud in some contexts
- Focus on this metric alone can increase missed fraud
- Less relevant when investigation process is non-disruptive

## 2. Advanced Evaluation Metrics

### ROC AUC (Receiver Operating Characteristic Area Under Curve)

**Definition:** Measures the model's ability to discriminate between classes across all possible thresholds. Plots true positive rate against false positive rate.

**Code Implementation:**
```python
metrics['roc_auc'] = roc_auc_score(y_true, y_prob)
```

**Pros:**
- Threshold-independent evaluation
- Ranges from 0.5 (random) to 1.0 (perfect)
- Widely used and understood
- Good for comparing overall model discrimination power

**Cons:**
- Can be overly optimistic for imbalanced data
- Less sensitive to the minority class performance
- Same AUC can represent different precision-recall tradeoffs
- Doesn't directly translate to business value

### PR AUC (Precision-Recall Area Under Curve)

**Definition:** Area under the precision-recall curve, focusing on model performance for the positive (fraud) class across thresholds.

**Code Implementation:**
```python
metrics['pr_auc'] = average_precision_score(y_true, y_prob)
```

**Pros:**
- More informative than ROC AUC for imbalanced data
- Focuses on the minority (fraud) class performance
- Not influenced by the large number of true negatives
- Better reflects performance in real-world fraud scenarios

**Cons:**
- Less widely used and understood than ROC AUC
- Harder to interpret absolute values
- Can vary significantly with class distribution changes
- Does not account for the cost-benefit structure of the problem

### Business Metrics (Net Savings)

**Definition:** Financial impact of the model based on costs and benefits of each outcome type.

**Code Implementation:**
```python
fraud_savings = tp * 200  # Each detected fraud saves $200
investigation_costs = fp * 10  # Each false alarm costs $10 to investigate
missed_fraud_costs = fn * 200  # Each missed fraud costs $200
metrics['net_savings'] = fraud_savings - investigation_costs - missed_fraud_costs
```

**Pros:**
- Directly ties model performance to business value
- Incorporates different costs for different error types
- Makes model comparison more meaningful for stakeholders
- Helps optimize for financial outcome rather than statistical metrics

**Cons:**
- Requires accurate cost and benefit estimates
- Simplifies complex business impact
- Values may change over time or across contexts
- Different stakeholders may have different cost-benefit perspectives

## 3. Threshold Optimization

### Finding the Optimal Threshold

**Definition:** The process of determining the ideal probability cutoff for classification that optimizes a specific criterion.

**Code Implementation:**
```python
def find_optimal_threshold(y_true, y_prob, criterion='f1'):
    # For F1 optimization
    if criterion == 'f1':
        # Calculate F1 score for each threshold
        f1_scores = []
        for i in range(len(precision)):
            if precision[i] + recall[i] > 0:
                f1 = 2 * (precision[i] * recall[i]) / (precision[i] + recall[i])
            else:
                f1 = 0
            f1_scores.append(f1)
            
        # Find threshold that maximizes F1 score
        best_idx = np.argmax(f1_scores[:-1])
        return thresholds[best_idx]
```

#### F1 Optimization

**Pros:**
- Balances precision and recall
- Good default choice when costs are unclear
- Single numeric optimization target

**Cons:**
- Assumes equal importance of precision and recall
- May not align with business objectives
- Can be sensitive to small changes in the data

#### Precision-Recall Balance

**Code Implementation:**
```python
# Find threshold where precision and recall are closest
differences = np.abs(precision - recall)
best_idx = np.argmin(differences[:-1])
```

**Pros:**
- Creates equal emphasis on catching fraud and minimizing false alarms
- Intuitive operating point
- Often creates reasonable default threshold

**Cons:**
- Equal precision and recall may not be optimal
- Ignores the costs of different error types
- Can be suboptimal for highly imbalanced problems

#### Cost-Based Optimization

**Code Implementation:**
```python
# Define a cost function (example: 10*FP + 500*FN)
costs = []
for t in thresholds:
    y_pred = (y_prob >= t).astype(int)
    tn, fp, fn, tp = confusion_matrix(y_true, y_pred).ravel()
    
    # Cost function
    cost = 10 * fp + 500 * fn
    costs.append(cost)
    
best_idx = np.argmin(costs)
```

**Pros:**
- Directly optimizes for business value
- Accounts for differing costs of error types
- Adaptable to different business contexts
- Can incorporate complex cost structures

**Cons:**
- Requires accurate cost estimates
- May be sensitive to cost ratio changes
- Can lead to extreme thresholds when costs are very unbalanced
- Difficult to verify optimality in practice
